# PetsRS-Dataset
The PetsRS-Dataset is a collection of dog and cat images organized in image pairs that belong to the same individual. 
This dataset is intended to be used for evaluating instance-level identification models for pet recognition and/or 
verification. The dataset is composed of 1834 images of dogs and 616 images of cats. These pictures were extracted 
from the PetsRS website, an application created by volunteers in the context of the 2024 floodings in the region 
surrounding the Guaiba waterbody in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The application aims to reconnect pets and guardians 
that were separated because of the floodings during evacuations. On one end of this application, guardians searching 
for their lost pets can submit pictures of the animal, on the other end, shelter volunteers and temporary guardians 
of rescued pets can do the same. This results in a crowd-sourced open database of lost and rescued. Pet recognition 
models were critical in this scenario and our dataset can evaluate how a model would perform in this real-world 
scenario where this task was needed.
